We can either do:
1. A call with you where we talk about the purpose of your site and your business, vs how your website appears to your target audience. Then we write up a long or short list of suggested edits. We can do this to 3 varying levels of granularity. - We can write either a detailed description or a general description of recommended colors, transitions, page items, element types, etc. We often recommend the "general description" because it's faster for us to do (it costs you less) and it's more fun. We can give your site a good harsh judge, write it down, and move on. But if you don't trust your Sam to execute on a more general plan, go with the "detailed description" of recommended changes. 
2. An limmediate" assessment of your site, based off of our own human reactions, our knowledge of web design best practices, and our understanding of your business' goals as we come to understand them from your site and your order description. 
Bonus: We can refer yo and your website to coders that we trust to design your site with the level of skill that weâ€™ve designed the list or higher. (this can refer to RR, or to a third party resource.)

Delivery time:
1 day of work for turnaround - it really takes us about 4 hours or less, but we like building in buffers and leeway. 

Cost: 
We bill by the hour at a rate of $250/hour. A typical project takes 2-4 hours, depending on the package purchased

Who owns the work after payment is delivered? 
You do. (If you're the customer) Do what you want with our assessments.
